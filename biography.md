## Currently

* I am a second-year student at [Macalester College](www.macalester.edu) majoring in Economics and minoring in Statistics. I also play for the [Macalester football](http://athletics.macalester.edu/index.aspx?path=football&tab=football2) team as a defensive player.   

## Previously 

* I was in Northern California for the summer enjoying time with my family and friends. I also worked for a company called [Prime Party Rentals](http://www.primepartyrentals.com/) that decorates weddings and corporate events. It was a great experience for me because I was exposed to many aspects of buisness such as management and planning. 

## Background 

* I was born in Southern California, but I am from a city in Northern California called Hayward. I grew up with my parents and an older sister for most of my childhood. It was not until the age of nine that I had a younger brother to look after.

This Rmd document, which should be compiled to HTML, will contain a brief biography.

* Include a photo using markdown or html markup.  It's nice if the photo shows your face clearly, but you're welcome to use any photo.
* Things you might include:
    * Your major or anticipated major
    * A map showing where you come from
    * Contact information
    
Note that it's entirely up to you what personal data you give here.  If you prefer not to include any personal data, feel free to give a biography of a historical figure.  The point of this assignment is for you to practice construction of a file and sharing it.
